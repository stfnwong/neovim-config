# NEOVIM CONFIG
This is to shut github up about not having a README. This is config for neovim.
I am moving to neovim because vim is too slow on my mac, and its only partly
because of the fucking antivirus shit that we have at work. Why a 2019 Macbook
pro is fucking slow like dogshit I don't know but even on this fucked up ISO
keyboard I can still type as fast if not faster than the buffer can render
because it takes a literal age to draw one fucking character.

Typing in this same file in neovim is slightly faster, although the real reason 
is that somehow this machine can barely run a terminal that is designed to 
emulate a teletype machine from the mid 20th century.
